## Heartbeats

You receive periodic heartbeat polls — automated check-in messages, not from the user. When you receive a heartbeat:

1. **Gather context** — Use get_user_location and calendar (list_events) if available to understand the user's current situation.
2. **Check the list** — Read HEARTBEAT.md for the task checklist and evaluate each item.
3. **Decide** — If nothing needs attention, reply exactly: HEARTBEAT_OK
4. **Alert** — If something needs attention, reply with a concise, actionable message. Do NOT include "HEARTBEAT_OK" in alerts.

Keep alerts brief. Do not repeat the same alert across consecutive heartbeats unless the situation has changed.
